# Stock Mock-et
This is the GitHub for the CEN semester long project where we will create a website dealing with stocks. We plan to have this website give the user the option to choose a company to view the stock records as a graph for the past day (in hours), past month (in days), and past year (in months), depending on which the user would prefer. The page will also provide the metrics and data related to the company's stocks between those time frames if that is preferred to the visual representation. In addition, we plan to create a system that tracks how much money (fake currency that is provide) you earn or lose when investing in the simulation stocks. 

The members of the front-end team are Brian Hersh and Fredderick Blanco. The members of the back-end team are Jonathan Leal and Josue Vicente.
